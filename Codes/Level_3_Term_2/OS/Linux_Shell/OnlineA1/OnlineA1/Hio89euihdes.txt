Youtube

YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno,
 California. The service was created by three former PayPal employees—Chad 
Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim—in February 2005. Google bought the 
site in November 2006 for US$1.65 billion;[4] YouTube now operates as one
 of Google's subsidiaries.[5] The site allows users to upload, view, rate,
 share, add to favorites, report and comment on videos, subscribe to other
 users, and it makes use of WebM, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, and Adobe Flash Video 
technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media
 videos. Available content includes video clips, TV show clips, music videos,
 short and documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers and other
content such as video blogging, short original videos, and educational videos.
