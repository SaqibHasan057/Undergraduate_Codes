Mineral

A mineral is a naturally occurring substance, representable by a 
chemical formula, that is usually solid and inorganic, and has a 
crystal structure. It is different from a rock, which can be an 
aggregate of minerals or non-minerals and does not have a specific 
chemical composition. The exact definition of a mineral is under 
debate, especially with respect to the requirement a valid species 
be abiogenic, and to a lesser extent with regard to it having an 
ordered atomic structure.[citation needed] The study of minerals 
is called mineralogy.

There are over 5,300 known mineral species; over 5,070 of these 
have been approved by the International Mineralogical Association 
(IMA). The silicate minerals compose over 90% of the Earth's crust. 
The diversity and abundance of mineral species is controlled by the 
Earth's chemistry. Silicon and oxygen constitute approximately 75% 
of the Earth's crust, which translates directly into the predominance 
of silicate minerals. Minerals are distinguished by various chemical 
and physical properties. Differences in chemical composition and crystal 
structure distinguish various species, and these properties in turn are 
influenced by the mineral's geological environment of formation. Changes 
in the temperature, pressure, or bulk composition of a rock mass cause 
changes in its minerals.
