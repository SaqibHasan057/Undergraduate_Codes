Valencia Orange

William Wolfskill, an American who became a Mexican citizen in the 1820s
 while working in Santa Fe, New Mexico as a fur trapper, migrated to California.
 He was given a land grant as a naturalized Mexican citizen under Mexican 
government rules. An American born in Kentucky and reared in Missouri, 
he cultivated numerous vineyards and grape varietals, and was the largest 
wine producer in the region. He continued to buy land, and later had sheep 
ranches, as well as developing extensive citrus orchards. He hybridized the 
Valencia orange, a sweet orange and named it for Valencia, Spain, which had a 
reputation for its sweet orange trees. These had originally been imported from 
India.
