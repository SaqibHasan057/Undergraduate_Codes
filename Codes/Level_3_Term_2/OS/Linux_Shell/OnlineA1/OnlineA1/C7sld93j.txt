Computer Programming

Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads
from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. 
Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating 
algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and 
resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms 
in a target programming language.
