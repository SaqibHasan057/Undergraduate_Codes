Asia Cup

The ACC Asia Cup is a men's One Day International & Twenty20 International cricket tournament. 
It was established in 1983 when the Asian Cricket Council was founded as a measure to promote 
goodwill between Asian countries. It was originally scheduled to be held every two years.

The first Asia cup was held in 1984 in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates where the council's 
offices were based (until 1995). India boycotted the 1986 tournament due to strained cricketing
 relations with Sri Lanka. Pakistan boycotted the 1990-91 tournament due to strained political 
relations with India. The 1993 tournament was cancelled due to strained political relations 
between India and Pakistan. The ACC has announced that the tournament will be held biennially 
from 2008 onwards.[2] The ICC has ruled that all games played in the Asia Cup have official ODI
 status.

After downsizing the Asian Cricket Council in 2015, it was announced by the ICC that Asia Cup 
events from 2016 will be played on a rotation basis between One Day International and Twenty20 
International format, on the basis of format of upcoming world events.[3] As a result, the 2016 
event will be first event played in the T20I format and will function as a preparatory tournament
 ahead of the 2016 ICC World Twenty20.
