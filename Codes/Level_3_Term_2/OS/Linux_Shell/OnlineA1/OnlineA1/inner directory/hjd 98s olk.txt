Open Market

Economists judge the "openness" of markets according to the amount of 
government regulation of those markets, the scope for competition, and 
the absence or presence of local cultural customs which get in the way 
of trade. In principle, a fully open market is a completely free market
 in which all economic actors can trade without any external constraint.
 In reality, few markets exist which are open to that extent, since they
 usually cannot operate without an enforceable legal framework for trade
 which guarantees security of property, the fulfillment of contractual 
obligations associated with transactions, and the prevention of cheating.
