Albert Einstein

Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Wurttemberg in the German 
Empire, on 14 March 1879.[17] His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman 
and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where 
Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. 
Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on 
direct current.[17]

The Einsteins were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews, and Albert attended a Catholic 
elementary school in Munich from the age of 5 for three years. At the age of 8, 
he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein 
Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education 
until he left the German Empire seven years later.
