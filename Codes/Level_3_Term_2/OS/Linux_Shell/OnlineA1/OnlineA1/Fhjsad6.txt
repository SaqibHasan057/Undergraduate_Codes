Gold price could be set to break $1300

After dropping on Friday after reaching a new 2016 high earlier in the session,
the metal finished down again on Monday and at the end of Asia's Tuesday trading
overnight. At a low of $1,225 an ounce, the spot price was three per cent down 
from last week's $1,282, notes Bullion Vault.

A recent resurgence on equities markets - or rather, the underlying sentiment 
driving this - has been partly to blame for the apparent turnaround. Pessimism 
on the global economy has eased as China has moved to reassure on its growth prospects,
which means investors are moving back into risk assets and easing up on their positions
in "safe havens" such as gold.
